# Todo List React Tutorial

This tutorial will teach ReactJS by building a Todo List. We will start by building the Front-End and then build on top of it little by little demonstrating Back-End and database technologies along the way. We will be building the Todo List from the ground up leveraging `create-react-app` for our Front-End bundling system.

## Getting Started

**Technologies**

* [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
* [`redux`](https://redux.js.org/)
* [`react-router-dom`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom)

### Setup Bundler and Initialize Repository

Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want your application to live.

```
npx create-react-app todo-list-app
```

This line of code will create a directory called `todo-list-app` inside the directory you navigated to. Not only did it create the application directory for you but if you look inside the directory you'll notice it has also scaffolded the initial application code you will need.

```
todo-list-app
├── README.md
├── node_modules
├── package.json
├── .gitignore
├── public
│   ├── favicon.ico
│   ├── index.html
│   └── manifest.json
└── src
    ├── App.css
    ├── App.js
    ├── App.test.js
    ├── index.css
    ├── index.js
    ├── logo.svg
    └── serviceWorker.js
```

Navigate into the the `todo-list-app` application directory from the terminal.

```
cd todo-list-app
```

There are some dependencies that we are going to need to add. From the terminal now that we are in the `todo-list-app` directory we'll use `npm` to install the necessary dependencies by running the following command.

```
npm install --save redux react-router-dom 
```

This one command installs `redux` and `react-router-dom` as dependencies in our project. The `README.md` in your `todo-list-app` application directory has details on all of the scripts available for running the build but we're going to take a look at just one of them for now. Go ahead and run the following command from your terminal in the `todo-list-app` directory.

```
npm start
```

When this is down building the Front-End files it will automagically launch a new tab in your web browser serve up a local version of the site. The start command has integrated into it a watch so when you save changes to your code it will run a live refresh of the webpage. At this point you could start developing anything you want.

SWEET!!!

Let's go ahead and setup your
